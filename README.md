# RecruitRIOProgram

This repository holds the RoboRIO program for new code team members. The objective is to allow new recruits to program their own RIO code, engaging them in a productive way and permits them to be a part of the active code development without having to worry about the RoboRIO program being broken. <br />
Note: This Repo does NOT contain the actual code that will be used at competition, rather, it is a training space for new members.

If you need help, please make a pull request/put code on a new branch/open an issue about it on github, that way when a more experinced code team member gets a change, they can fix the code.


Please Install the following to develop.
